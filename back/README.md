# Buyercrowd - Backend

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python package and environment management.

## Docker Compose

Start the local development environment with Docker Compose following the guide in [../development.md](../development.md).

## General Workflow

By default, the dependencies are managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), go there and install it.

From `./back/` you can install all the dependencies with:

```console
$ uv sync
```

Then you can activate the virtual environment with:

```console
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

Make sure your editor is using the correct Python virtual environment, with the interpreter at `back/.venv/bin/python`.

Modify or add SQLModel models for data and SQL tables in `./back/app/apps/*/models.py`, API endpoints in `./back/app/apps/*/router.py`, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) utils in `./back/app/apps/*/crud.py`.

## VS Code

There are already configurations in place to run the backend through the VS Code debugger, so that you can use breakpoints, pause and explore variables, etc.

The setup is also already configured so you can run the tests through the VS Code Python tests tab.

## Backend tests

To test the backend run:

```console
$ bash ./scripts/test.sh
```

The tests run with Pytest, modify and add tests to `./back/app/apps/*/tests/`.

If you use GitHub Actions the tests will run automatically.

### Test Coverage

When the tests are run, a file `htmlcov/index.html` is generated, you can open it in your browser to see the coverage of the tests.

## Migrations

As during local development your app directory is mounted as a volume inside the container, you can also run the migrations with `alembic` commands inside the container and the migration code will be in your app directory (instead of being only inside the container). So you can add it to your git repository.

Make sure you create a "revision" of your models and that you "upgrade" your database with that revision every time you change them. As this is what will update the tables in your database. Otherwise, your application will have errors.

- Alembic is already configured to import your SQLModel models from `./back/app/models.py`.

- After adding a table model import it in `./back/app/models.py` for alembic to know about it.

- After adding or changing a model (for example, adding a column), create a revision, e.g.:

```console
$ alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add column last_name to User model"
```

- Commit to the git repository the files generated in the alembic directory.

- After creating the revision, run the migration in the database (this is what will actually change the database):

```console
$ alembic upgrade head
```

## Email Templates

The email templates are in `./back/app/email-templates/`. Here, there are two directories: `build` and `src`. The `src` directory contains the source files that are used to build the final email templates. The `build` directory contains the final email templates that are used by the application.

Before continuing, ensure you have the [MJML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=attilabuti.vscode-mjml) installed in your VS Code.

Once you have the MJML extension installed, you can create a new email template in the `src` directory. After creating the new email template and with the `.mjml` file open in your editor, open the command palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` and search for `MJML: Export to HTML`. This will convert the `.mjml` file to a `.html` file and now you can save it in the build directory.
